# AGENTS.md: print studio website template

One-page website for a print studio or small press, with a price calculator, shop and workshop dates. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__toggle` `.nav__close`
  - `scene:press-pass`: `.press__art` `.lane` `.press__band` `.press__panel` `.drum` `.drum__disc`
  - `section-script:quote`: `.quote__form` `.quote__ticket` `data-out` `data-quote-mail` `.quote__lines` `data-setup` `data-passes` `data-rate` `data-factor` `data-label` `data-days-small` `data-days-mid` `data-days-large`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `data-sent`
  - `scene:inks-register`: `.inks__stage` `.inks__plate--blue` `.inks__plate--pink`
  - `scene:process-run`: `.process__window` `.process__track` `.sheet__plate--blue` `.sheet__plate--pink` `.sheet__under`
  - `scene:editions-pistons`: `.editions__rack` `.editions__lane--low` `.editions__lane--high` `.editions__trail`
  - `scene:workshops-index`: `.workshops__lane` `.workshops__carriage` `.session`
  - `scene:runs-lens`: `.run__client`
  - `scene:contact-landing`: `.contact__lanes` `.lane` `.drum` `.lane__print`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Two inks,` is 9, `ten thousand dots.` is 18, `dotdrum` is 7.
- The drums, lanes, halftone trails, the colour chart and the sample sheet are HTML and CSS (gradients and masks), not images: recolour them through the tokens.
- The quote calculator's rates are data attributes on the form; change them there, and the currency in section-script:quote.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #11138d (ultramarine: the blue bands and the text on paper white), `--color-2` #ed008e (fluorescent pink: drums, halftone trails, buttons, the studio and questions bands), `--color-3` #f3f3fa (paper white bands, and the text on blue), `--color-4` #07061f (near-black: text on pink, button labels, secondary text on paper white); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, form, phone, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Order links under each of the eight editions: now mailto:shop@dotdrum.example with the edition in the subject; owner's target: your shop or checkout URL for each edition (or keep the email with your real address).
- Book a place links under each of the five workshops: now mailto:hello@dotdrum.example with the workshop in the subject; owner's target: your booking or ticketing URL for each session (or keep the email with your real address).
- The Send this ticket button in the quote section: now a mailto: address (the script adds the job lines); owner's target: your real email address, or your own quote or order form.
- The form in `#quote` (fields `format`, `copies`, `inks`, `paper`, `sides`) is a live price calculator, not a contact form: `section-script:quote` updates the job ticket and builds the Send this ticket mailto link. Keep it; the rates live in its data attributes.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Dotdrum (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (13, Unsplash: opening 1, studio 3, editions 8, workshops 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Known limits
- Lighthouse lists gsap and ScrollTrigger as render-blocking (about 1 s on mobile); they sit at the end of body and the motion scripts after them need them loaded.
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay and the job ticket shows its default job only; the links stay reachable in the hero and the footer.
- On screens shorter than 640 px the first screen grows past the viewport and the print starts later; the process stage needs about 600 px of height on phones, below that the sheet shrinks.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Dotdrum left only in class names.
