# AGENTS.md: florist website template

Website for a florist or flower shop with delivery, standing orders, events and workshops. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__menu` `.menu__close` `.menu__links`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.op__hold`
  - `scene:dusk`: `.op__night` `.op__photo` `.op__w--1` `.op__w--2` `.op__and` `.op__statement` `.op__ribbon`
  - `scene:bench`: `.bench__ph` `.bench__row` `.bench__name` `.bench__rows`
  - `scene:drift`: `.work__grid` `.work__item`
  - `scene:hours`: `.dusk__run` `.dusk__stage` `.dusk__track` `.dusk__panel` `.dusk__hour` `.dusk__ph`
  - `scene:gather`: `.ev__board` `.ev__ph`
  - `scene:miles`: `.gr__row` `.gr__rows` `.gr__pin` `.gr__line`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct__form` `.ct__done`
  - `scene:letter`: `.nt__frame` `.nt__letter`
  - `scene:card`: `.ct__card` `.ct__room`
  - `scene:mark`: `.ft__mark` `.ft__rect` `.ft__dome` `.ft__bar`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Moth and Marigold` is 17, `after five` is 10, `rooms in bloom` is 14, `goodnight` is 9, `dear marigold` is 13.
- The brand marks in the nav and the footer are drawn from simple shapes (an inline SVG and three CSS blocks), not images: recolour them through the CSS variables, or replace them with your logo.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #eecbc0 (blush page background and cards), `--color-2` #331917 (chocolate text and dark sections), `--color-3` #fc72c4 (hot pink script lines and button hover), `--color-4` #a0146c (magenta workshop band, distance pins and second script colour); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, social, email, form): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Order for tonight buttons in the nav, the phone menu and the first screen: now #contact; owner's target: your online shop or order page URL (or keep the order form in contact).
- Build a bouquet from the bench (under the stem list): now #contact; owner's target: your shop's product page or order form URL.
- Start the Jar / Start the Mantel / Ask about the Lobby in standing orders: now #contact; owner's target: the sign-up or subscription checkout URL of each order.
- Plan an event buttons (first screen and events): now #events and #contact; owner's target: your event enquiry form or booking URL.
- Save a seat in the workshops section: now #contact; owner's target: your workshop booking or ticket URL.
- See every arrangement (row link under arrangements) and Instagram in the footer: now https://www.instagram.com/; owner's target: your Instagram profile or portfolio URL.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `contact`, `date`, `budget`, `note`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Moth & Marigold (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (27, Unsplash: opening 1, season 6, work 6, dusk 5, events 6, school 1, notes 1, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay; the links stay reachable in the footer.
- Long words in the width-filling wordmark need the --len value updated, or the line overflows or looks small.
