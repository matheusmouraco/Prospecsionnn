# AGENTS.md: construction company website template

One-page website for a construction company: a home renovation and extension contractor. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__bar` `.nav__num` `.nav__label` `.index` `.nav__index` `.index__close` `data-8b-section` `.chapter` `.chapter__num` `.chapter__label` `data-step`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.wall`
  - `section-script:crew`: `.crew__shuffle` `.crew__status` `data-message`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.contact__form` `.contact__status`
  - `scene:opening`: `.opening__first` `.opening__ground` `.wall` `.wall__joints` `.wall__level` `.wall__course` `.opening__room` `.opening__copy` `.opening__panel` `.wall__block`
  - `scene:services-index`: `.services__frame` `.services__list` `.svc`
  - `scene:work-gather`: `.work__sheet` `.work__item`
  - `scene:materials-fan`: `.materials__strips` `.mat` `.mat__tone`
  - `scene:process-courses`: `.process__wall`
  - `scene:promise-stack`: `.promise__type` `.promise__word` `.promise__copy` `.promise__rule` `.promise__list`
  - `scene:reviews-stack`: `.review` `.review__body`
  - `scene:contact-lines`: `.contact__title` `.contact__line--a` `.contact__line--b` `.contact__sheet`
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Fixed` is 5.
- Chapter numbers and labels are written in each section's intro ("02 ( Services )"), in the Index list and in the footer's "Back to 01 Practice ↑" link; the top bar reads them from the sections. When you add, remove or rename a section, update all three.
- The wall of blocks on the first screen and the process blocks are HTML and CSS, not images: restyle them through the colour variables.
- Red (--color-7) is used only for measuring marks, link hover lines and focus outlines; keep it off large areas and body text.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (white page background), `--color-2` #0c0c0c (black text, buttons, gallery and footer), `--color-3` #f2f2f2 (light grey panels and form sheet), `--color-4` #dcdcdc (pale grey hairlines and blocks), `--color-5` #444444 (dark grey blocks and button hover), `--color-6` #2a2a2a (charcoal cards and blocks), `--color-7` #d4351c (red measuring marks, link hover lines and focus outlines), `--color-8` #6b6b6b (grey small labels); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- "Book a visit" (nav) and "Book a site visit" (first screen): now #contact; owner's target: your booking or calendar URL if you use one (or keep the anchor to the form).
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `job`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Ashlar Build (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (30, Unsplash: opening 1, services 5, survey 1, work 12, materials 5, crew 5, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for

Use only real reviews you have permission to publish.
- Response time: "we will call within one working day" (contact text and the #contact-ok message).
- "© 2026 Ashlar Build LLC" (footer).

## Known limits
- The order-of-work wall is laid out for exactly five stages; a sixth needs its own place in the grid.
- Shuffle re-orders the crew in the browser only; the order in the file is the order on load.
- On desktop the process section shows only its heading for the first part of its scroll, until the first block lands (intended: the empty site before the first course).
- Without JavaScript the Index button and the chapter arrows do nothing. The footer links only Services, Work, Order of work and Questions (plus Back to 01 Practice); Survey, Materials, Promise, Crew and Reviews have no other link, and Contact is reached through the first-screen Book a site visit button.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Ashlar Build left only in class names.
