# AGENTS.md: creative agency website template

Website for a creative agency or production house, with a portfolio, services, team and studio. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `scene:hero`: `.m-mark__glyph` `.hero__push`
  - `scene:manifesto`: `.manifesto__line`
  - `scene:works`: `.works__card` `.works__plate`
  - `scene:feature`: `.feature__frame` `.feature__img` `.feature__title`
  - `scene:expertise`: `.expertise__row` `.expertise__portrait-in` `.expertise__body`
  - `scene:method`: `.method__track` `.method__frame`
  - `scene:crew`: `.crew__grid` `.crew__card`
  - `scene:footer`: `.m-mark__glyph`
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__toggle` `.nav__menu` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:works`: `.works__cell` `.works__card` `.works__status` `data-filter` `data-tags` `data-template`
- `hero` directly above `manifesto`, `works` directly above `feature`: the animation crosses that border and stops if they are split.
- `style="--len:N"` = characters in that display line, spaces included: `Not what` is 8, `a brand says.` is 13, `What stays` is 10, `in the room.` is 12, `The Amber Hour` is 14, `hello@sillage.example` is 21.
- The wordmark is HTML text, one span per letter with a data-glyph copy for the trail: change the letters in both the hero and the footer and set --len to the number of letters.
- The works filter matches each card's data-tags against the buttons' data-filter values: keep them in sync when you change the categories.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page background, cuts through the wordmark), `--color-2` #0b0b0b (text, rules, buttons, dark services section), `--color-3` #676767 (secondary text), `--color-4` #9b9b9b (spare light grey for small text, defined in the variables but unused by the demo), `--color-5` #cfcfcf (light rules, grey plates behind photos), `--color-6` #2f2f2f (rules on the dark section); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, email, phone, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Request the full reel (works): now mailto:hello@ (subject Full reel); owner's target: your showreel URL (Vimeo, YouTube), or keep the email.
- Request the case (feature): now mailto:hello@ (subject The Amber Hour); owner's target: the case study page or film of that project.
- Book the studio (studio): now mailto:studio@ (subject Studio booking); owner's target: your booking form or calendar; remove the studio section if you have no space to rent.
- The name Sillage (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (22, Unsplash: hero 1, works 8, feature 1, expertise 1, method 4, studio 1, crew 6): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Client and project names in works (Ondine Parfums — Night Bloom, Halcyon Eyewear — White Noise, Maison Orrel — Hard Line looks, Atelier Vauque — Volume Studies, Northe Joaillerie — Ten Rings, Lumen & Ash — Gilt, Casa Albar — Copper Line, Kestrel — Hands On), the hero caption "Halcyon — Red Season, campaign film", the featured project "The Amber Hour" for Ondine Parfums (feature) and the ten names in clients (also Brunner Genève, Vellum): all invented; publish only clients you may name.
- "Eight stories from the last two seasons" (works note) and "some for one launch, most for years" (clients note).
- Feature credits: "Two shoot days at Studio Sillage", "212 assets for 14 markets", "Edit, colour, 3D and retouch in-house" (feature).
- Services and in-house claims: the five disciplines and their tags, including "AI-assisted workflows", "Rooftop daylight" and "Crew catering" (expertise), "one floor", "our own workshop", "one crew" (manifesto, expertise, method).
- The studio and its specs: "Studio Sillage, Montreuil", "Six hundred square metres", "ten minutes from Paris", a 12 × 8 m cyclorama with 6 m clear height, a 140 m² north-facing rooftop, a workshop, chef-led catering "for crews of up to sixty" (studio, expertise).
- Team: "Forty-two strategists, producers, editors and retouchers" (crew note), six named people with roles — Élise Marchetti, Tomasz Wren, Adaeze Okafor, Henri Paz, Noor Haddad, Julien Ferreira — shown with stock portraits (crew), and "We are hiring producers, retouchers and strategists" (crew).
- Contacts: Clara Vidal, managing partner and Julien Ferreira, studio manager; "read every Friday"; the emails hello@, studio@, jobs@, press@sillage.example and the phones +33 1 00 00 00 00 / 01 (contact, navigation overlay, works and feature buttons, studio button, crew).
- Addresses: "1 rue de l’Exemple, 75003 Paris" (office) and "2 rue de l’Exemple, 93100 Montreuil" (studio) are placeholders (contact).
- Location: Paris and Montreuil in the meta description, the studio heading and "© 2026 Sillage. Paris — Montreuil." (footer).

## Known limits
- Without JavaScript the works filter does nothing (all eight projects stay visible) and the phone Menu button cannot open its overlay; on phones the section links (Work, Expertise, Method, Studio, People, Contact) live only in that overlay, and the footer has only social links and Back to top.
- The stencil slit in the wordmark is drawn in the page colour: while the split wordmark passes over the hero photo the slits show as thin white lines.
- On phones the width-filling email line in contact is set small (about 20 px) so a long address fits.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Sillage left only in class names.
