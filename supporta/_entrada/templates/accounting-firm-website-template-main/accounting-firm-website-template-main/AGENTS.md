# AGENTS.md: accounting firm website template

One-page website for an accounting and bookkeeping firm that works for small businesses. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:nav`: `.nav__menu` `.menu__close`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.op-level`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct-form` `.ct-thanks`
  - `scene:opening`: `.op-two` `.op-rule` `.op-one` `.op-a` `.ln__i` `.op-h1` `.op-sub` `.l-b` `.op-say` `.l-a` `.op-tile` `.op-para`
  - `scene:month`: `.mo-board` `.mo-fill` `.mo-marker` `.mo-task`
  - `scene:clients`: `.cl-title` `.cl-globe` `.cl-half--a` `.cl-half--b`
  - `scene:switch`: `.sw-tile` `.sw-ring__arc`
  - `scene:team`: `.tm-row` `.tm-card`
  - `scene:principle`: `.pc-l` `.pc-dot`
  - `scene:reviews`: `.rv-stack` `.rv-sheet`
  - `scene:footer`: `.ft-word` `.ft-a` `.ft-b` `.ghost__a` `.ghost__b`
- The spirit-level vial, the logo mark, the vertical rule and the rings in the switch section are CSS and SVG, not images: recolour them through the CSS variables.
- Client cards sit on the sphere by their inline --lat and --lon angles. To add a card, give it its own pair (spread them evenly); a card without them sits on the pole on top of another.
- The brand name is split in two halves in two places: the footer wordmark (.ft-a, .ft-b; its style="--len:8" is the number of characters of the whole word and sizes it to fill the width) and the grey corner halves (.ghost__a, .ghost__b). Split your name the same way, or put the whole name in the first half and leave the second empty.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #ffffff (page background, white review sheets, text on the black screen), `--color-2` #0b0b0b (text, vertical rule, buttons, black second screen, switch tiles once their ring closes), `--color-3` #f2f2f2 (grey client cards, alternate review sheets, switch tiles waiting for their ring), `--color-4` #6b6b6b (labels, column heads, roles, captions, month tasks the marker has not reached), `--color-5` #8f8f8f (grey wordmark halves in the screen corners, ring tracks), `--color-6` #d12a1e (the only accent: level bubble, logo dot, month marker, rings, button hover, full stop), `--color-8` #dadada (hairlines between service rows and under each fee item); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form, map): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a free call button in the first screen: now #contact; owner's target: your booking calendar URL (Calendly, Cal.com) if you take bookings there, or keep it on the contact form.
- The map icon in the footer: now an OpenStreetMap search for Bristol; owner's target: the map URL of your office.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `email`, `business`, `message`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Evenkeel (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (19, Unsplash: opening 4, clients 10, team 4, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:

- Service: "Twenty minutes, free" first call (contact) and "we will call you within one working day" (the form's thank-you line).
- Footer: "© 2026 Evenkeel Accountants Ltd · Company no. 00000000" — put in your legal name and registration number.

## Known limits
- Lighthouse lists gsap and ScrollTrigger as render-blocking; they sit at the end of body and the motion scripts after them need them loaded.
- Without JavaScript the Menu button cannot open the overlay; the footer links stay reachable.
- The grey corner halves are mid grey (about 3.2:1 on white) so they stay visible; they sit behind the content.
- Review sheets keep some empty space under short quotes, so the stack keeps its rhythm.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Evenkeel left only in class names.
