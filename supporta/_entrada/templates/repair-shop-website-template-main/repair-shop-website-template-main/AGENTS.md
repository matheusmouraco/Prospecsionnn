# AGENTS.md: repair shop website template

Website for a phone and laptop repair shop with walk-in repairs, prices and refurbished devices. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `scene:opening`: `.op-stage` `.op-wm` `.op-flood` `.op-second` `.op-copy` `.op-bar` `.op-wm__row` `data-r` `.op-stair__word` `.op-tile` `.m-select`
  - `scene:diagnosis-scan`: `.dg-inner` `.dg-list` `.dg-band`
  - `scene:bench-strips`: `.bn-photo` `.bn-strip` `.bn-w`
  - `scene:refurb-shelf`: `.rf-pin` `.rf-track`
  - `scene:fleet-cursor`: `.fl-board` `.fl-cursor` `.fl-track` `.fl-win` `.fl-bar`
  - `scene:reviews-read`: `.rv-quote` `.rv-sel`
  - `scene:visit-grow`: `.vs-title` `.vs-w`
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__bar` `.nav__menu` `.nav__toggle` `.nav__menu-close`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.op-stage`
  - `section-script:visit`: `.vs-form` `.vs-status` `data-ok` `data-error`
- The REFLOW wordmark on the first screen is not a font: each letter is a 5-column grid of rounded dashes in the markup (.op-wm__letter, .op-wm__row, <i style="grid-column:…">). For another name, redraw the letters in the same way, or replace the block with text.
- The time bars on the price wall (style="--m:<minutes>") and the pickup windows (style="--a:<hour>;--b:<hour>") are sized from those numbers: update them together with the visible times.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #0e0e0e (near-black grained sections), `--color-2` #f5f5f5 (off-white sections, headings), `--color-3` #d0d0d0 (text on dark, wordmark), `--color-4` #8e8e8e (muted text on dark), `--color-5` #575757 (muted text on light), `--color-6` #0000ff (electric blue highlights), `--color-7` #1b1b1b (hairlines on dark), `--color-8` #e2e2e2 (hairlines, form panel); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, form): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a repair buttons in the nav, the first screen and the footer: now #visit; owner's target: your booking page, or keep #visit if the form on the page is connected.
- Reserve links on the five refurbished devices: now #visit; owner's target: each device's product or checkout page in your shop.
- Request a box button in the repair-by-post section: now #visit; owner's target: your mail-in request form or booking page.
- Open an account button in the business section: now mailto:fleet@reflow.example; owner's target: your business-accounts email or sign-up form.
- The form in `#visit` (fields `name`, `contact`, `device`, `model`, `fault`, `when`) sends nothing; `section-script:visit` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Reflow (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (11, Unsplash: opening 3, bench 1, parts 1, refurb 5, visit 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

## Ask the owner for
All demo text, never to be invented:
- Address and area: "23 Tib Street, Northern Quarter, Manchester M4 1LX" in full in visit, in shorter forms in the nav menu, opening bar and footer, and "on Tib Street" (opening paragraph, bench caption, meta description); directions "Four minutes from the Market Street tram stop. Bike rack outside the window." (visit). The street is real; the shop and the number are invented.
- Phone 0161 000 0000 and emails bench@reflow.example, fleet@reflow.example (replaced placeholders: the phone in the nav menu, opening bar, refurb note, visit and footer; fleet@ on the Open an account button).

- "Since 2014" (opening paragraph) and the company "Reflow Repair Ltd · Registered in England" (footer).
- Service promises: a free fifteen-minute diagnosis, twelve checks, a fixed price before work starts, most screens and batteries back "within the hour", the bench in the shop window with a magnifier camera, nothing goes to a back room (opening, diagnosis, bench, meta description).

- Warranty: 12 months on repairs and refurbished devices, 6 months on Value parts, VAT included, "you pay the cheaper price" (prices, parts, refurb, faq, reviews, meta description).

- Reviews by Priya (Pixel 7), Tom (MacBook Pro 13") and Aisha (iPad Air) (reviews).
- FAQ answers: passcode handling, ultrasonic board cleaning with an answer within a day, what the warranty covers, buying broken devices (faq).
- Booking: "We will confirm your slot by text or email within the hour" (the form's data-ok message in visit).

## Known limits
- Lighthouse lists gsap and ScrollTrigger as render-blocking; they sit at the end of body and the motion scripts after them need them loaded.
- The diagnosis checklist pins only on screens at least 1024 px wide and 760 px tall (with motion allowed); on phones, tablets and shorter screens the band runs while the list scrolls past.
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the overlay; the links stay reachable in the footer.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Reflow left only in class names.
