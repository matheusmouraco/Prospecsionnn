# AGENTS.md: veterinary website template

Website for a veterinary clinic or animal hospital. One file, `index.html`, with inline CSS and scripts (GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis from jsDelivr); no build step, and none is needed for copy, colour or photo edits.

## Keep
- Every `id`, `data-8b-section`, `data-8b-motion` and `data-8b-part` (`section:<id>` styles, `scene:<id>` animation).
- Selectors the scripts use:
  - `section-script:navigation`: `.nav__sheet` `.nav__toggle` `.nav__close`
  - `section-script:opening`: `.op-first`
  - `scene:opening-door`: `.op-shape--arch` `.op-door` `.op-second` `.op-photo` `.op-visit__title` `.op-step__mark` `.op-shape`
  - `scene:doors-open`: `.dr-grid` `.dr-door` `.dr-door__frame`
  - `scene:species-deal`: `.sp-row` `.sp-panel`
  - `scene:care-index`: `.ca-row` `.ca-frame` `.ca-rule`
  - `scene:patients-track`: `.pt-pin` `.pt-track` `.pt-card` `data-track`
  - `section-script:contact`: `.ct-form` `.ct-status`
  - `scene:story-walk`: `.st-frame` `.st-text`
  - `scene:contact-arch`: `.ct-panel`
- The coloured shapes, the arch logo mark and the coral doorway are CSS (border-radius and clip-path), not images: recolour them through the --color-* variables.
- The second screen of the opening (the four steps on the coral arch) belongs to the same section as the first screen; the arch animation measures both, so keep them together.
- Colours and fonts are variables in `:root` (`data-8b-part="tokens"`): `--color-1` #f7efe2 (cream page background), `--color-2` #1f0b08 (dark brown text and prices band), `--color-3` #ebe2d3 (darker cream panels and cards), `--color-4` #6a5c53 (grey-brown secondary text such as roles, captions and footer lines), `--color-5` #f26b45 (coral buttons, arches and contact panel), `--color-6` #63a4bc (blue dogs panel and shapes), `--color-7` #dcb155 (mustard round cats panel), `--color-8` #96503f (rust small mammals panel), `--color-9` #3dac91 (green birds and reptiles panel), `--color-10` #e2a8d3 (pink accent shapes), `--color-11` #8e8565 (khaki circle accents beside the first headline and the species panels); body text needs 4.5:1 contrast.
- With reduced motion the page must read in full.
- Keep the header comment and `<meta name="generator">`. Keep the "Design: 8B" footer link unless the site owner asks to remove it.

## Replace
- `data-8b-placeholder` (og-image, favicon, phone, email, map, form, social): real value in, attribute out; no value, remove the row (no image: drop `og:image`, set `twitter:card` to `summary`).
- Book a visit buttons (nav, phone menu, hero, footer): now #contact; owner's target: your online booking page, or keep them on the contact form.
- Privacy link in the footer: now #contact; owner's target: your privacy policy page.
- The form in `#contact` (fields `name`, `phone`, `pet`, `species`, `reason`) sends nothing; `section-script:contact` validates it and shows the thank-you text. Formspree: `action="https://formspree.io/f/<id>"` and `fetch` POST `new FormData(form)` first. Netlify: `data-netlify="true"` and a hidden `form-name`. Or delete it and the script.
- The name Burrow (any letter case); the favicon letter and colours in `<link rel="icon">`.
- Photos (26, Unsplash: opening 1, clinic-sides 2, species 4, services 6, team 4, patients 7, story 1, contact 1): `src`, no `srcset`/`sizes`, `width`/`height` to the ratio, `alt`, CREDITS.md.
- `<title>`, meta description, og tags.

- Business name and form: "© 2026 Burrow Veterinary PC" (footer) and "Burrow Veterinary" in the logo, title and copy.

## Known limits
- On phones the growing arch is stretched more in height than in width, so mid-scroll it reads as a tall coral door; it lands exactly on the second screen's arch.
- The service photos fold back into their small pill as a row leaves the top of the screen; at rest (no JavaScript, reduced motion) every photo is open.
- The building photo in story shows a shop sign and street signs of the real place it was taken; replace it with a photo of your own building.
- Without JavaScript the phone menu button cannot open the link sheet; the links stay reachable in the footer.

## Check
375 and 1440 px, reduced motion on, console clean; `data-8b-placeholder` and Burrow left only in class names.
