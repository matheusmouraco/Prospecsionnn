        question: "What changes between monthly and per-project pricing?",
        answer: "Monthly is an ongoing seat with one active request at a time. Per project is a fixed brief, timeline, and deliverable list—ideal when you need a single launch, rebrand, or campaign kit.",
    },
    {
        id: "p5Faq2",
        question: "Is the figure on the calculator the final fee?",
        answer: "It is a transparent starting estimate. After discovery we confirm scope, add-ons, and any rush needs so both sides sign the same number with zero surprises.",
    },
    {
        id: "p5Faq3",
        question: "How long does a typical engagement run?",
        answer: "Monthly partners often stay three months or longer. Fixed projects commonly land in 3–8 weeks depending on complexity and how quickly feedback returns.",
    },
    {
        id: "p5Faq4",
        question: "Who is doing the creative work?",
        answer: "Senior specialists inside Orisa lead every deliverable—no opaque subcontract chain. You always know the designer or director reviewing your files.",
    },
    {
        id: "p5Faq5",
        question: "What do you need from us to begin?",
        answer: "Goals, brand assets (if any), timeline, and stakeholder list. A short kickoff workshop is enough for us to build the first brief and start shipping.",
    },
    {
        id: "p5Faq6",
        question: "Is post-launch support included?",
        answer: "Yes. Monthly partners keep an open request lane. Project clients receive a polish window after handoff; longer support can roll into a new monthly seat.",
    },
